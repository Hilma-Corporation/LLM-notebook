It is the risk that an asset or security cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss or meet an obligation.\n\nIn simple terms, credit risk is about the risk of not getting your money back, while liquidity risk is about the risk of not being able to convert an asset into cash quickly.</s>[INST]Can you provide examples of situations where credit risk and liquidity risk might occur?[/INST]"}

This risk is typically assessed through a borrower's credit score, income, employment history, and other relevant financial information. \n\nIf a borrower is deemed high risk, lenders may charge a higher interest rate to compensate for the potential loss.

This insurance can be either public or private depending upon the insurer. The policy is also known as a mortgage guaranty.\n\nEssentially, if a borrower can't pay their mortgage, the insurance will cover a portion or all of the lender's loss. This reduces the risk for the lender and allows them to offer loans to borrowers who might otherwise be considered too high risk, like those who can't afford a 20% down payment.\n\nThere are two types of mortgage insurance: Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) and Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP).
