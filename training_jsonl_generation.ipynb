    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to generate frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their corresponding answers using the OpenAI API. The process involves generating questions based on given themes, querying the OpenAI API for answers, and saving the results in structured files for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Environment Variables**\n",
    "   - Load the API key from a `.env` file to interact with the OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Necessary Functions**\n",
    "   - Define functions to query the OpenAI API and generate questions based on given themes.\n",
    "   - Define functions to create training and validation files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Themes and Generate Questions**\n",
    "   - Define the themes for which FAQs are to be generated.\n",
    "   - Query the OpenAI API to generate 50 questions per theme.\n",
    "   - Save the generated questions into an `instructions.json` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load Instructions and Generate Q&A Pairs**\n",
    "   - Load the instructions from the `instructions.json` file.\n",
    "   - Query the OpenAI API to generate answers for each question and follow-up questions.\n",
    "   - Save the results in structured training and validation files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation involves four main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Environment Variables**: This step involves loading the API key from the `.env` file to ensure secure access to the OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Necessary Functions**: Functions are defined to query the OpenAI API to generate questions and responses. Another function is used to create training and validation files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Setting Themes and Generating Questions**: Themes are defined, and the OpenAI API is queried to generate 50 questions for each theme. The questions are then saved to an `instructions.json` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loading Instructions and Generating Q&A Pairs**: The instructions are loaded from the `instructions.json` file, and the OpenAI API is used to generate answers and follow-up questions for each instruction. The results are saved in structured training and validation files.\n"

    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python code performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports necessary modules**:\n",
    "   - `os`: This module provides a way to interact with the operating system, especially for accessing environment variables.\n",
    "   - `dotenv`: This module is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loads environment variables**:\n",
    "   - `load_dotenv()`: This function loads the environment variables defined in the `.env` file into the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieves the API key**:\n",
    "   - `os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')`: This function fetches the value of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and stores it in the `api_key` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validates the API key**:\n",
    "   - The code checks if `api_key` is `None` or empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the API key was not found and instructs the user to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.\n"
